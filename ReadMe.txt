# Chess_engine_Java
The aim of this project is to build a fully functioning Java chess engine. Move generation as well as captures are made via "bitboards",i.e. 64-bit integers (long) where each represents a case of the chequerboard. 0 = case is free, 1 = case is occupied.

Move operations are computed via the â€œBitboard" Class.
